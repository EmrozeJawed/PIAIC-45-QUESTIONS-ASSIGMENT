// Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.
let names: string [] = ["Bilal", "hasnain", "Usaim", "Ali"];
console.log (`${names[0]} is my best friend`)
console.log (`${names[1]} is my best friend`)
console.log (`${names[2]} is my best friend`)
console.log (`${names[3]} is my best friend`)
